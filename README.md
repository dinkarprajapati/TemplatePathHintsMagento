# Template Path Hints Magento

This module was developed in order to help me to easily enable template path hints for Magento without logging into backend. Just add query string to your Magento frontend URL as below and boom:
?th=1

I have only tested this on Magento ver. 1.9.3.2. Feel free to test in 1.x version and let me know.
